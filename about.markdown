This is Shuai! I'm interesting on reinforcement learning. Here is some learning note for RL. Hope it will give you some help.

I wrote a Distributed DRL framework [Distributed-RL](https://github.com/LiuShuai26/Distributed-RL) by Ray and TensorFlow with Tutorial on Github.

I also participate in [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jserenity) competition.
